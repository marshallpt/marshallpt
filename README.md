### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Patrick Marshall!

Currently a working software developer, my personal Github contains what I mess around with in my freetime, as well as some of my undergraduate work.

Previously worked as an undergraduate researcher in the [HIVE Lab at VCU,](https://rampages.us/thehivelab/) funded by 
the [VCU OpenCity project.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9562813) I developed a 
[ROS2](https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2020/6/5/ros-2-foxy-fitzroy-release) package for our autonomous adaptation of the 
[Waveshare PiRacer](https://www.waveshare.com/piracer-ai-kit.htm) platform, which consisted of both software and hardware architectural design work.
