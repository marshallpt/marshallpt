### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Patrick Marshall, a fourth-year computer engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University! 

Currently, I work as an undergraduate research assistant in the [HIVE Lab at VCU,](https://rampages.us/thehivelab/) funded by 
the [VCU OpenCity project.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9562813) I'm developing a 
[ROS2](https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2020/6/5/ros-2-foxy-fitzroy-release) package for the 
[Waveshare PiRacer](https://www.waveshare.com/piracer-ai-kit.htm), which is why I have so much activity in private repositories.
